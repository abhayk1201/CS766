# Summary Statement

Image classification is the task of taking an image and producing a label that classifies the image. For example given a picture of dog we would like the image classification algorithm to produce the label ‘dog’.

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/cbutkus/CS766/edit/master/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.
